A project revolves around a Django-based framework to create a website, to address one of the most common issues, in medical aid - instant diagnosis in time of need. Created a website that takes in basic information from the patient and give a detailed analysis using our AI designed Chatbot - NutriBot, as well as a well graphed chart of Continuous Heartrate Monitoring. The goal was to maximize help, with least effort.
